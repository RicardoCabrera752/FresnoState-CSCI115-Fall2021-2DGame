# CSCI 115 2D Game

This project is a 2D turn-based maze game designed to showcase the Dijkstra Shortest Path algorithm on a graph data structure.
I created the game using C++ and OOP principles.

The game is a simple ASCII maze where the main objective is to not let the enemies touch you.

How to run the game:

You must run this program on an IDE that supports at least C++14. For convenience, it is recommened that you run this program on at least Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 or above.

You can find the download for Visial Studio here: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/

First download the source code ZIP and extract the files to a new folder onto your machine. Then open Visual Studio and navigate to File in the menu bar. Select Open Project/Solution and find the folder you created that has the source code. Select the file named CSCI 115 Project-Ricardo Cabrera.sln and open it.

Start the game by running the local windows debugger using the toolbar.

Play the maze game and try to surive as long as your can.

If you need more information see the readme2.txt file or the project report document.
